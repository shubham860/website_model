 <hr>
  <p>Jaisalmer town  nicknamed "The Golden city", is a city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, located 575 kilometres (357 mi) west of the state capital Jaipur. Once known as Jaisalmer state it is a World Heritage Site. The town stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone, and is crowned by the ancient Jaisalmer Fort. This fort contains a royal palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples of both the fort, and of the town below, are built of finely sculptured sandstone. The town lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (the Great Indian Desert) and has a total population, including the residents of the fort, of about 78,000.

      <h5>JAISALMER FORT</h5>
      <p>Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is believed to be one of the very few (perhaps the only) “living forts” in the world, as nearly one fourth of the old city's population still resides within the fort. </p>

     <h5>VYAS CHHATRI</h5>
      <p>One of the best places in Jaisalmer to observe a sunset, the Vyas Chhatri is a specimen of really intricate carvings and delicate designs. To the curious, Chhatris are the Rajasthan's spin to cenotaphs, and this one is dedicated to sage Vyas, who completed the 300,000 verse long epic, Mahabharata and dedicated it to Lord</p>
